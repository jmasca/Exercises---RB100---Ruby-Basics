Exercise 2:

Modify the following code so that double-quotes are used instead of single-quotes.

puts 'It\'s now 12 o\'clock.'

Expected output:

It's now 12 o'clock.



Solution:
puts "It's now 12 o'clock."

When using single quotes on a string that contain single quotes in them like, it's or
o'clock, you need to use the escape sequence \ in order to have the ' be printed. This
is the only character you can use the escape sequence on when using single quotes. If you
choose to use double quotes you can use other escape sequences like a newline "\n".
