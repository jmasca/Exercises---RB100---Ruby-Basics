Exercise 3:

Assume you have the following code:

s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
puts s.split.inspect
puts s.split(',').inspect
puts s.split(',', 2).inspect

What will each of the 3 puts statements print?



Solution:

The #inspect method will give us a printable version of our results.


1a. The #split method with no arguments will use whitespace to separate the string into
an array of individual strings.

1b. -> ["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]


2a. The (',') argument passed to #split will cause split to use a comma as a delimiter (separator).

2b. -> ["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr", "stu vwx yz"]


3a. The (',', 2) argument passed to #split will split the string into an array just as the previous
split did, but we have an optional argument of 2 that was also passed. This means that no more than 1
splits will occur (n-1) and we will get a two substring array returned.

3b. -> ["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"]
