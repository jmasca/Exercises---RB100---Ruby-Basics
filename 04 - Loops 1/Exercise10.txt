Exercise 10:

Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, use a for loop to greet
each friend individually.

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']



Solution:

for friend in friends
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end

We are using the 'friend' variable in the for loop to represent each friend in the
'friends' array. Then we output our greeting with each friend.
