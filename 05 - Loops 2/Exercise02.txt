Exercise 2:

Modify the following code so that the loop stops if number is equal to or between 0 and 10.

loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
end



Solution:

loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
  break if number >= 0 && number <= 10
end

The modifications that we chose to use here was an 'if' statement following the 'break'
statement. The condition in the 'if' is using the logical AND operator (&&) to determine
if the number is greater than or equal to zero AND less than or equal to ten. When both
of these conditions are true, the 'break' statement will execute.


The provided solution used the #between? method from the Comparable module. #between? takes
two arguments, the minimum value and the maximum value. This method will return 'true' if
the number is between or equal to the two values provided.

loop do
  number = rand(100)
  puts number
  break if number.between?(0, 10)
end
