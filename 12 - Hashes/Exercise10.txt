Exercise 10:

Rewrite car as a nested array containing the same key-value pairs.

car = {
  type:  'sedan',
  color: 'blue',
  year:  2003
}



Solution:

car = [[:type, 'sedan'], [:color, 'blue'], [:year, 2003]]

This is merely practice on converting the data from a hash into a nested array. The
exercise is designed to make the strengths of a hash standout when a label is required.
