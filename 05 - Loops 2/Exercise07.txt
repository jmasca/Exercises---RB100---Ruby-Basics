Exercise 7:

The method below counts from 0 to 4. Modify the block so that it prints the current number
and stops iterating when the current number equals 2.

5.times do |index|
  puts index
  # ...
end



Solution:

5.times do |index|
  puts index
  break if index == 2
end

The solution to this problem only requires adding one line of code. We add the 'break'
statement after we print the value of the current number being held by the block variable
'index'. We test the condition of the 'index', or current number, being equal to 2 in the
'if' statement following the 'break'. When this statement is 'true' we'll exit the loop.
