Exercise 8:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
  10
end

puts count_sheep



Solution:
0
1
2
3
4
10

The above code will do the same as the previous exercise inside of the method. It will
print the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, the difference in this code is the 10 after the
#times method and before the end of the method definition. Since this line is executed, the
method will implicitly return its value, 10. After the 10 is returned to the #puts
statement that called 'count_sheep', the 10 will also be printed. Therefore, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 10 are printed.
