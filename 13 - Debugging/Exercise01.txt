Exercise 1:

You come across the following code. What errors does it raise for the given examples and
what exactly do the error messages mean?

def find_first_nonzero_among(numbers)
  numbers.each do |n|
    return n if n.nonzero?
  end
end

# Examples

find_first_nonzero_among(0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0)
find_first_nonzero_among(1)



Solution:
The first example will have an error that states that too many arguments were provided. The
method 'find_first_nonzero_among' only has one parameter. The second example will give an
error stating that integers do not have an #each method. This method is expecting an array.

The examples should be arrays:
find_first_nonzero_among([0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0])
find_first_nonzero_among([1])

Specific Errors Raised:
ArgumentError
NoMethodError
