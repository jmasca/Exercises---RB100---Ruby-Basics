Exercise 5:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal



Solution:
Dinner
nil

The above code is going to print the string 'Dinner', followed by 'nil'. After the method
call and inside of the method, the first line 'Dinner' doesn't do anything. The next line,
however, will #puts the string 'Dinner', as expected. Since this is the last line being
executed inside of the method definition, this will also return the provided value. In this
case, the provided value will be the value that #puts returns, which is 'nil'. The 'p' on
line 6 with the method call will print out the value that was returned, nil.
Note: The 'p' is used to display useful output for debugging purposes, so nil is showed.
