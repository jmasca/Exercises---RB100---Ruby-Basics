Exercise 9:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried
to answer.

a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a



Solution:

This code will print: 7

We will get the printout of the value 7 because the block on line 4 is creating
a local variable defined to the scope of the block. This variable 'a' is being used
on line 5 where it is incremented. However, since we have two variable names pointing
to two different values, the 'a' variable on line 1 is never modified. Thus, the 'puts a'
on line 8 will give us the value of 7.

From the discussion of the solution itself:
"This problem demonstrates shadowing. Shadowing occurs when a block argument hides a
local variable that is defined outside the block. Since the outer a is shadowed, the
a += 1 has no effect on it. In fact, that statement has no effect at all."
