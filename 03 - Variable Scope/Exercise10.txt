Exercise 10:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried
to answer.

a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

def my_value(ary)
  ary.each do |b|
    a += b
  end
end

my_value(array)
puts a



Solution:

This code will print another error message. This is a similar scenario as earlier when
the method assignment on line 6 produces an error since it does not have access to the
variable 'a' that was defined on line 1. There is no 'a' variable initialized inside of the
method and we cannot increment nil. Thus, an error message is produced.
