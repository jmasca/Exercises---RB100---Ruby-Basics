Exercise 7:

The following code outputs a countdown from 10 to 1. Modify the code so that it counts from
1 to 10 instead.

count = 10

until count == 0
  puts count
  count -= 1
end



Solution:

count = 1

until count == 11
  puts count
  count += 1
end

The solution chose was to make the least amount of modifications to the code as possible.
First, the count variable needs to begin at 1, rather than 10. Then, the test condition
for the 'until' loop needs to be equal to 11 to ensure 10 numbers are printed. Lastly, we
need to increment the counter instead of decrement.
