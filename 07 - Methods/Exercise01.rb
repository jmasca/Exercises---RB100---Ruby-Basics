#Exercise 1:
#Write a method named print_me that prints 'I'm printing within the method!'
#when invoked as follows:
#print_me


#Solution:
def print_me
	puts "I'm printing within the method!"
end

print_me

#The only thing required is a #puts inside of the method definition.
#Note: Remember that #puts returns nil, so the method returns nil.
