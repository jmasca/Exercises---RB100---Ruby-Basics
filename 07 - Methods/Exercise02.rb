#Exercise 2:
#Write a method named print_me so that 'I'm printing the return value!' is
#printed when running the following code:
#puts print_me


#Solution:
def print_me
	"I'm printing the return value!"
end

puts print_me

#This time, we only need a String inside of the method definition.
#Note: Remember, with the keyword 'return' or not, every method will return
#something (usually, the last line).
