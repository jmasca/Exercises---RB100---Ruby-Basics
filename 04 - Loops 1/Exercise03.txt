Exercise 3:

Modify the following loop so it iterates 5 times instead of just once.

iterations = 1

loop do
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
  break
end



Solution:

iterations = 1

loop do
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
  iterations += 1
  break if iterations > 5
end

To make this loop iterate 5 times instead of just once we would need to do two things. The
first is to increment our control variable, which in our case will be 'iterations', and
after the incrementation we need a control statement to test a condition before we reach
our 'break'. We can use an 'if' statement to test if 'iterations' has increased beyond 5,
and when it does we will break out of the loop using the 'break' statement.


Further Exploration

If the break statement is moved up one line so it runs before iterations is incremented,
what would need to be changed?

Solution:

The only thing that would need to be changed is the condition being tested after our
control statement. So, after the 'if iterations' we would need '>= 5' rather than just '>'.
