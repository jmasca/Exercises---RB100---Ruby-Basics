Exercise 5:

Modify the code below so "Hello!" is printed 5 times.

say_hello = true

while say_hello
  puts 'Hello!'
  say_hello = false
end



Solution:

say_hello = true
i = 1

while say_hello
  puts 'Hello!'
  i += 1
  say_hello = false if i > 5
end

If we want to modify the existing code to print 'Hello' 5 times, rather than once, we need
three things. The first is a control variable, or a counter variable. Here we used 'i' to represent the iterations. Next, we need to increment the counter variable after 'puts
hello'. Every time we print our target string, 'Hello', we can increment our counter. The
last thing we need is a conditional statement to test when we should make 'say_hello'
become 'false'. We will test our counter after each pass/increment. When our counter is
greater than 5 we have printed the 'Hello' 5 times and its safe to set 'say_hello' to
'false'. Doing so will exit the loop after printing 'Hello' 5 times.
