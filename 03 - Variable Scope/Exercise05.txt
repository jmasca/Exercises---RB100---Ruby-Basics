Exercise 5:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried
to answer.

a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a



Solution:

The code will print: Xyzzy

This is a similar code to Exercise 4, but here, on line 4, we are not reassigning an
index value, we're simply assigning the method scoped variable 'b' to a new value of
'yzzyX'. Since the method call on line 7 isn't reassigning or printing the value, the
'puts a' on line 8 will use the value of the local variable on line 1, 'Xyzzy'.
