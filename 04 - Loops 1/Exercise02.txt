Exercise 2:

The code below is an example of a nested loop. Both loops currently loop infinitely. Modify
the code so each loop stops after the first iteration.

loop do
  puts 'This is the outer loop.'

  loop do
    puts 'This is the inner loop.'
  end
end

puts 'This is outside all loops.'



Solution:

loop do
  puts 'This is the outer loop.'

  loop do
    puts 'This is the inner loop.'
    break
  end

  break
end

puts 'This is outside all loops.'

The solution to this problem to make the loops only perform one iteration would be to add
break statements into the appropriate locations. We would need to exit the inner loop first
by providing a break statement on line 6, after the 'puts', but before 'end'. Then, to exit
the outer loop we would need another break statement after the 'end' of the inner loop.
This would now be on line 8, but adding a newline for readability would put the outer loops
break statement on line 9. Both loops now iterate once through and break out of them.
