Exercise 3:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
end

puts meal



Solution:
Breakfast

The above code will print the string 'Breakfast'. This is because of the 'return' statement
in the method definition. When 'meal' is called, the first line executed in the method is
the 'return' statement, followed by 'Breakfast'. The 'return' will immediately exit the
method and return whatever value is provided, in this case, 'Breakfast'. The line with the
string 'Dinner' never gets executed. #puts will print the returned value of 'Breakfast'.
