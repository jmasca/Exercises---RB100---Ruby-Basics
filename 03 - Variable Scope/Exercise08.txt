Exercise 8:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried
to answer.

array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a



Solution:

This code will print an error message because the 'puts a' on line 7 does not have access
to the variable defined inside of the block on line 4. With blocks we can access
variables inside that were initialized outside, but once outside the block we can't
access variables that were initialized inside. We will get an undefined variable error.
