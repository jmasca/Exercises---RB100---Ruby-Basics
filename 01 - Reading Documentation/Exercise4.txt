Exercise 4:

In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless break is used.
Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value break sets the return
value to for the while loop.



Solution:

The break statement will also return nil, unless you specifically supply a value as an argument.

A value can be provided as an argument to the break statement after the keyword break:
	-> break "this is the return value now"
