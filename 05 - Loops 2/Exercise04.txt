Exercise 4:

The code below asks the user "What does 2 + 2 equal?" and uses #gets to retrieve the user's
answer. Modify the code so "That's correct!" is printed and the loop stops when the user's
answer equals 4. Print "Wrong answer. Try again!" if the user's answer doesn't equal 4.

loop do
  puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
  answer = gets.chomp.to_i
end



Solution:

loop do
  puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
  answer = gets.chomp.to_i

  if answer == 4
    puts "That's correct!"
    break
  end
  
  puts "Try again!"
end

This is a fairly straightforward 'if' statement inside of the loop. If the user's response
is equal to 4 then we print out "That's correct!" and 'break' from the loop. If the user's
response is anything other than 4 we continue to loop after printing "Try again!"
