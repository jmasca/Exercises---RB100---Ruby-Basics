Exercise 9:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
    if sheep >= 2
      return
    end
  end
end

p count_sheep



Solution:
0
1
2
nil

The above code will print 0-2 and nil. Inside of the method definition we use Integer#times
on the integer 5 and #puts the value. After the value is printed we enter a conditional
'if' statement to determine if the integer value is greater than or equal to the value 2.
When this is 'true' the method will immediately return and not execute any further. There
is no return value with the 'return' statement, so 'nil' is the value that is returned by
the 'count_sheep' method. We used 'p' to print out nil. So, 0, 1, 2, and nil are printed.
