Exercise 4:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried
to answer.

a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a



Solution:

This code will print: Xy-zy

On line 1, the local variable 'a' is assigned the value 'Xyzzy', and this value is passed
to the method 'my_value' on line 7. When the index of this string is accessed via the
parameter 'b' on line 4, the character '-' is assigned to replace index 2, the first 'z'.
Modifying the index of a string in this way is destructive and mutates the caller itself. This means, the first 'z' of 'Xyzzy' at index 2 is replaced with a '-' not only in the
method, but within the memory address itself. Since the local variable 'a' is also
pointing to this string, it is altered, as well. When 'puts a' occurs on line 8, the
string has been modified and the output becomes 'Xy-zy'.
