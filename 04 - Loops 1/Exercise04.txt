Exercise 4:

Modify the code below so the loop stops iterating when the user inputs 'yes'.

loop do
  puts 'Should I stop looping?'
  answer = gets.chomp
end



Solution:

loop do
  puts 'Should I stop looping?'
  answer = gets.chomp

  break if answer == 'yes'
end

To modify this code correctly we would need to add a 'break' statement and a conditional
test. After input from the user is stored into the variable 'answer' we can add our 'break'
statement and conditional test following it. We want to test if the user input that is
stored in 'answer' is equal to the string 'yes'. Once it is, the break will execute and we
will exit the loop.
