Exercise 4:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  puts 'Dinner'
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal



Solution:
Dinner
Breakfast

The code above will print the string 'Dinner' and then the string 'Breakfast'. On line 6,
the 'meal' method is called. The first line of this method will #puts the string 'Dinner'.
Since there is no return statement on this line, and there are more lines following it, we
go to the next line which is a 'return' statement. The method immediately exits and returns
the provided value, which is 'Breakfast'. #puts will then print 'Breakfast'.
