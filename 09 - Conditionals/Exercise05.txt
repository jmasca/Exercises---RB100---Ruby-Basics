Exercise 5:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end



Solution:
My favorite number is 7.

The code above is going to print this string because when the 'number' variable is tested
in the if statement, the 'number' variable is going to evaluate to 'true'. In Ruby, every
expression evaluates to 'true' except for 'false' and 'nil'. Therefore, the if statement
will evaluate to 'true' and #puts will print the string "My favorite number is 7."
