Exercise 2:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  'Evening'
end

puts meal



Solution:
Evening

The code above will print the string 'Evening'. This is because the method 'meal', being
called on line 5, will return the string 'Evening'. Even without the 'return' statement a
method returns the value from the last line executed. This would be 'Evening'. The #puts
will then print the string.
