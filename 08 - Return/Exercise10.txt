Exercise 10:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def tricky_number
  if true
    number = 1
  else
    2
  end
end

puts tricky_number



Solution:
1

The code above will print the value 1. This time, the method definition is using an 'if'
statement. The 'if' will execute when its expression evaluates to 'true'. Since the
expression following the 'if' is the boolean value 'true', the 'if' clause is executed
and the 'number' variable is assigned to 1. Nothing else in this method will execute, thus,
the returned value from this method will also be a 1. #puts prints the value 1.
