Exercise 8:

Given the array of several numbers below, use an until loop to print each number.

numbers = [7, 9, 13, 25, 18]



Solution:

numbers = [7, 9, 13, 25, 18]

until numbers.empty?
  puts numbers.shift
end

-- However, this will empty the numbers array. --

To keep the array intact:

numbers = [7, 9, 13, 25, 18]

count = 0

until count == numbers.size
  puts numbers[count]
  count += 1
end

-- This matches the solution provided and is good practice since we have more control over
the number of iterations and the 'count' variable is doubling as the index value we want printed from the array. Also, the numbers array remains unmodified. --
