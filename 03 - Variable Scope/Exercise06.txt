Exercise 6:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried
to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b = a + a
end

my_value(a)
puts a



Solution:

This code will display an error message because the variable 'a' being used on line 4
has not been defined within the method 'my_value'. Methods do not have direct access to
variables initialized outside of the method.
