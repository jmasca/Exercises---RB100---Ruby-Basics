Exercise 1:

What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a



Solution:

This code will print the value 7. We assign a local variable 'a' to 7 on line 1. 'a' is
passed into the method on line 7, but it isn't being assigned to any variable or output in
any way. So, even though the method will return the value of 17, the value will be lost.
Also, since it's a non-destructive action the method will not mutate the variable 'a' itself.
Thus, 'puts a' on line 8 will print the value of 'a', which remains at 7.
