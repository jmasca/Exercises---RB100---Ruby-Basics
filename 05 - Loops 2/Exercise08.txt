Exercise 8:

Using next, modify the code below so that it only prints even numbers.

number = 0

until number == 10
  number += 1
  puts number
end



Solution:

number = 0

until number == 10
  number += 1
  next if number.odd?
  puts number
end

Here, we modify the code by adding one line between the incrementation of number and the
printing of number. 'next' will skip the remainder of the loop and jump to the next
iteration. We add the 'if' statement and the #odd? method to test if the number is odd. If
the number is odd, 'next' will skip the remaining code of the loop (which is to print the
number) and cycle back to the top where we increment number and test the condition again.
We will only be printing the even numbers now.


Further Exploration

Why did next have to be placed after the incrementation of number and before #puts?

-- The 'next' had to placed before the #puts to make sure the odd numbers weren't printed.
It also had to come after the incrementation because otherwise we would create an infinite
loop as soon as we reached an odd number. We would cycle to the top over and over again
with whatever odd number we had.

Further Exploration: Why did next have to be placed after the incrementation of number and before #puts?

I think it's important to answer this question. It seems fairly straightforward why we want
the next to be placed before #puts (to avoid printing the odd numbers), however, it's
equally as important to know why we place the next after the incrementation. We do so
because if next was before the incrementation we would be creating an infinite loop. As
soon as we get our first odd number (1), next would cycle back to the top of the loop
without incrementing. We would then test the if condition, still have the same odd number
(1), and next would cycle back to the top... over and over and over.
