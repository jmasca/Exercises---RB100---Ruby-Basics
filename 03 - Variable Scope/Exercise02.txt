Exercise 2:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a



Solution:

This code is going to print the same value as the previous question, 7. This is because the local
variable 'a' being assigned on line 1 is given a local scope, and the variable 'a' in the method
definition on line 3 and line 4 is given a method scope. Even though the variables share the same
name, they are pointing to two different memory addresses. Thus, as the last question went, even
though the method will return the value 17, it isn't being reassigned, assigned, or output, so we
will not see this value at all. Instead, 'puts a' on line 8 will print the value of the local
variable 'a' from line 1, which is 7.
