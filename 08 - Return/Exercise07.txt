Exercise 7:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep|
    puts sheep
  end
end

puts count_sheep



Solution:
0
1
2
3
4
5

The above code will print out the integers 0 through 5. The 'count_sheep' method is called
on line 7. Once we're in the method, the #times method uses 'sheep' as its parameter to
represent the integer values. Since the #times method was called on the integer 5, the
#puts on the next line will print the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. (zero to self - 1). The
#times method also returns self, which in this case is 5. Since there are no more lines to
be executed inside of the method, the method will return the result of the last line that
was executed (5). The #puts on line 7 then prints the integer 5. Thus 0-5 is printed.
