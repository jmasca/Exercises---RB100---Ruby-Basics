Exercise 8:

Use the ruby documentation for the String class to determine which method
can be used to right justify a String object.



Solution:

When looking at the String class documentation there's a method called #rjust
that can be used to right justify a String object. The #rjust method takes an
argument 'size' which will determine the number of characters to right justify
the object. There's another optional argument that can be given if you want the
padding to be anything other than whitespace.

	-> "string".rjust(10, '*')
