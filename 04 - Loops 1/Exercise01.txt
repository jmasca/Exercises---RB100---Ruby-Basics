Exercise 1:

The code below is an example of an infinite loop. The name describes exactly what it does:
loop infinitely. This loop isn't useful in a real program, though. Modify the code so the
loop stops after the first iteration.

loop do
  puts 'Just keep printing...'
end



Solution:

loop do
  puts 'Just keep printing...'
  break
end

The necessary modification to make this code stop after the first iteration would be to
supply a way to exit the loop. The easiest way to do that is with the break statement.
When reaching a break statement the program will immediately exit the loop.
