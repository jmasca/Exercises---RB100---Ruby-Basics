Exercise 3:

What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have
tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  a = b
end

my_value(a + 5)
puts a



Solution:

This code will also print the value 7. The argument 'a + 5' that's being
passed to 'my_value' on line 8 will pass the value 12. A method scoped variable
'a' is then assigned this value on line 4. However, since the 'puts a' on line
8 is using the locally scoped variable from line 1, the output will be 7.
