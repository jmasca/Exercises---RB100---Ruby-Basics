Exercise 1:

Write a loop that prints numbers 1-5 and whether the number is even or odd. Use the code
below to get started.

count = 1

loop do
  count += 1
end



Solution:

count = 1

loop do
  if count.odd?
    puts "#{count} is odd!"
  else
    puts "#{count} is even!"
  end
  count += 1
  break if count > 5
end

In this problem, we want to perform an if/else conditional check on the value of 'count' to
determine if it's an odd number or an even number. We will go ahead and use the #odd?
method on the 'count' variable to determine if it's an odd or even number. If it comes back
odd, we print the number and that it's odd, otherwise, we print the number and the fact
that it's even. Then, we need a way to exit the loop after we've printed 5 numbers, so we
add a 'break' statement with a conditional of exiting when 'count' is greater than 5
(5 being the number of iterations we wanted to perform).
