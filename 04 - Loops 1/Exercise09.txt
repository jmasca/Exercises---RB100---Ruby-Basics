Exercise 9:

The code below shows an example of a for loop. Modify the code so that it only outputs i if
i is an odd number.

for i in 1..100
  puts i
end



Solution:

for i in 1..100
  puts i if i % 2 != 0
end

The only modification to the code we would need to make is to add a conditional statement
after the 'puts i'. We add an 'if' statement with 'i % 2 != 0'. Using the modulus, any
number that comes back with a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 is even. Any time it comes
back with something other than 0 it will be an odd number. Therefore, any time the
remainder from 'i % 2' is not equal to 0, we print that number (only the odd numbers).


There is an even easier solution that was provided. This would be to use the #odd? method
on the integer variable 'i'. This method simply returns true if the integer is odd.
 -> puts i if i.odd?
