Exercise 2:

Assume you have this Array:

a = %w(a b c d e)

How would you use Array#insert to insert the numbers 5, 6, and 7 between the elements
with values 'c' and 'd'?



Solution:

We would use Array#insert with the positive index of the element we want to insert before, or
with the negative index of the element we want to insert after.
In our example, we want to insert numbers between 'c' and 'd', so we'll use the positive index
of 'd', which is 3. This will allow us to insert our new elements before the 'd' (but after 'c').

	-> a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)
