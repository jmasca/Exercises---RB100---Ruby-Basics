Exercise 6:

Using a while loop, print 5 random numbers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The code below
shows an example of how to begin solving this exercise.

numbers = []

while <condition>
  # ...
end



Solution:

#my solution:
numbers = Array(1..99)
counter = 1

while counter < 6
  puts numbers[rand(98)]
  counter += 1
end


#Provided Solution:
numbers = []

while numbers.size < 5
  numbers << rand(100)
end

puts numbers


NOTE: Although the solution I came up with is working and correct, the provided solution is
more efficient. I chose to store 100 integers in an array, create a counter variable, and
increment that counter variable to exit the loop after 5 numbers. My solution also has the
random number as an index, which then has to go into the array to pull the number out.
The provided solution has a test condition checking the size of the array and storing
random numbers into the array until it has 5 numbers. After it has its 5 numbers, the loop
exits and the numbers are printed. This solution saves time and memory.
