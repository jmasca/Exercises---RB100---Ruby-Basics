Exercise 1:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal



Solution:
Breakfast

The code above will print the string 'Breakfast'. This is because the method 'meal', being
called on line 5, will return the string 'Breakfast'. The 'return' statement will
immediately exit a method and return the provided value. Then, the #puts prints the string.
