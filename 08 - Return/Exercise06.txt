Exercise 6:

What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

puts meal



Solution:
Breakfast

The code above will only print the string 'Breakfast'. This is because the very first line
in the method definition is the 'return' statement returning the string 'Breakfast'.
Nothing after this line is going to be executed in the method. The #puts on line 7 will
then print 'Breakfast'.
